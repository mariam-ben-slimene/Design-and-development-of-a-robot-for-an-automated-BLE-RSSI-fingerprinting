# Design-and-development-of-a-robot-for-an-automated-BLE-RSSI-fingerprinting

The Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprint matching method, also known as scene analysis, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for location tracking. This approach consists in locating a mobile node based on the collected RSSI signature.
The fingerprinting process is automated using a robot equipped with a BLE module (CC2650STK BLE sensortag). In this setup, the user controls the robot's movements, directing it along a predefined path. During its journey, the robot collects RSSI signals from various anchor nodes located at different positions within the scene. These gathered RSSI signatures are then stored within a fingerprinting database.
